# JC COVID-19 Information
This web application is created for the second assignment of the Interactive Development module, a year-1 module in the pursuance of my diploma studies at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

This web application mainly provides Singapore’s COVID-19 information such as the statistics, top headlines, DORSCON Status, Phase Level and some COVID-19 advisories.

However, users can also search for COVID-19 statistics of a specific country by inputting a country’s name. The APIs utilised will fetch the relevant data and modify accordingly through jQuery DOM Manipulation. Global stats are also available.

The statistics includes:
* Total Amount of Cases
* Recovered Cases Figures
* Deceased Figures
* Active Cases Figures
* Current Critical Condition Figures
* In Community Facilities Figures (Singapore Only)
* Hospitalized and In Stable Condition Figures (Singapore Only)

## Design Process & Rationale
This website is created for Singaporeans as the primary user and as well as non-Singaporeans as a secondary user. The web application compiles and consolidate COVID-19 Information and news into a single site and allow interested or concerned users to view these data in a glance.

As there are plenty of such data on the internet, such as WHO’s website, MOH’s website, GOV.sg’s website and etc, users may find it inconvenient to navigate from one to another to view these data and news. Thus, this site compiles these data and Singapore’s news into one and allow users to view at ease.

Website’s Scope & Agenda:
1. Simple & Intuitive
2. Provide Good UI & UX to allow users to have a pleasant experience when searching for these data.
3. Allow users to view up-to-date local, global and other countries figures related to COVID-19.
4. Allow users to view latest and up-to-date local (SG) news related to COVID-19.
5. Provides COVID-19 advisories to users and subsequently prevent the spread of the virus.
